'''River Water Level Analysis
You receive water level data collected every 30 minutes over 15 days for a river (shape: 15 x 48).

Tasks:

Find the day with the highest average water level.

Check if water level crossed a critical threshold (e.g., 9.5 m) at any point.

Determine peak water level time for each day.

Identify days where the water level rose continuously for 6 or more intervals.'''
